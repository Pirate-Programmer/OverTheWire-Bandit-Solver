<p>Passwords have been reset D:</p>

<p>Bandit Solver is very much for YOU!!!</p>

Bandit Solver is my second ever script so pls do pardon my amateur work. I would visit bandit ctf on random days and quite frustating to see the passwords have been reset. As u can see the script has the solution of the levels emebbed cause i wanted to preserve the solutions where i can refer back to.
