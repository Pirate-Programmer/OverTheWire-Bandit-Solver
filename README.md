Bandit Solver is my second ever script so pls do pardon my amateur work. I would visit bandit ctf on random days and it was quite frustating to see the passwords have been reset. As u can see the script has the solution of the levels emebbed cause i wanted to preserve the solutions where i can refer back to.

PS: Do not refer the the embeded solutions. They are not meant to make any sense. It was needed for parsing the output
